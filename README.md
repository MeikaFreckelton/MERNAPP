# README - Developer platform



## Purpose of the website

The purpose of our application is to provide a welcoming environment for developers to put themselves out there and connect to other developers, as well as potential employers. It also simplifies the process of employers finding a suitable person for any specific role, by being able to filter through the profiles of users based on the skills or experience needed. Additionally, it is also a platform where developers can share their ideas through public blog posts to further develop their profiles and their presence on the site, for other users to view and connect with and for potential employers to gain an even better understanding of the developer.
