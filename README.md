It also simplifies the process of employers finding a suitable person to fit any specific role, by being able to filter through the profiles of users based on the skills and experience needed. Additionally, it is also a platform where developers can share their ideas through public blog posts to further develop their profiles and their presence on the site, for other users to view and connect with and for potential employers to gain an even better understanding of the developer.
